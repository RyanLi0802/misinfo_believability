"I am outraged. This signage by @TheWharfDC says NO MASKS‚Äîa critical and lifesaving public health intervention‚Äîare allowed on Wharf property. Meanwhile, we are still experiencing a pandemic of COVID-19, an airborne virus. @_DCHealth @MayorBowser https://t.co/qHLCWoGrae"

The tweet has received 1571 retweets.



The author of the tweet has only 3118 followers, which indicates that the user is not very influential. However, the tweet itself has received 1571 retweets, which is a significant number of endorsements considering the author's follower count. The tweet contains negative sentiment, and negative emotions sway people more than neutral or positive ones. The message addresses a public health concern, specifically the use of masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is a prevalent narrative. However, the tweet's claim that "NO MASKS" are allowed on Wharf property seems to conflict with common-sense knowledge, as most places have been encouraging or requiring mask-wearing during the pandemic.

Given the mixed factors, the tweet is likely going to be believed by few.
