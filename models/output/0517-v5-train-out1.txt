The message is followed by a photo of two Sesame Street characters with the words "Celebrating Latinx Heritage Month."

The tweet has received 176 retweets.

The tweet has received 36 retweets.

The tweet is posted by a user with a relatively large number of followers (88,768), but not enough to be considered highly influential. The tweet has received 36 retweets, which is not a high level of endorsement. However, the tweet contains negative sentiment and targets Nate Silver, a well-known statistician, which could appeal to those who distrust experts or mainstream media. The message also requires some level of expertise to debunk, as it involves understanding statistical models and election predictions. Given the population's susceptibility to misinformation, polarization, and emotional sway, it is possible that the tweet could be believed by many, especially if it aligns with their prior beliefs.

A user with 168380 followers has tweeted the following potentially misleading message:

"no fucking way https://t.co/99qQzcbwfd"

The message is followed by an article from MarketWatch titled, "Elon Musk to Sell 80% of His Tesla Stock to Purchase Twitter." It was first published on May 17, 2022, and last updated on May 20, 2022. The article is written by Therese Poletti and states that Elon Musk plans to sell a massive portion of his stock to take control of Twitter and promises to return free speech.

The tweet has received 732 retweets.

The tweet is posted by a user with a significant number of followers (168,380), but not enough to be considered highly influential. The tweet has received a moderate number of retweets (732), which could trigger some bandwagon behavior but is not considered widely endorsed. The tweet contains a link to an article from a reputable source (MarketWatch), which could lend credibility to the claim. The message itself does not contain negative sentiment, but the topic of free speech could resonate with people who have strong opinions on the matter. The claim that Elon Musk would sell a large portion of his Tesla stock to purchase Twitter is sensational but does not directly conflict with common-sense knowledge. Debunking the message might require some research, but it is not beyond the reach of an average person.

Considering these factors, the tweet might be believed by many in the given population. Yes.

2. Dream ($7.9 Billion)
3. Obama (696 Million)
4. HasanAbi (House)
5. TommyInnit (100 Million)"

The tweet has received 7361 retweets.

The tweet is posted by a highly influential user with 5,931,148 followers, which could trigger bandwagon behavior. However, the tweet has only received 7,361 retweets, which is below the 9,000 retweets threshold for being considered widely endorsed.

The tweet does not contain negative sentiment, as it is more of a humorous or satirical message rather than one that evokes negative emotions such as hate, anger, or fear.

The message does not contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs, as it is a list of supposedly richest Twitch streamers, including a former president (Obama) and a streamer being valued by their house (HasanAbi). This makes the tweet seem more like a joke than a serious claim.

Debunking the message does not require a certain level of expertise, as the numbers provided are clearly exaggerated (e.g., Xqc's 1.3 trillion) and the inclusion of Obama as a Twitch streamer is obviously false.

Considering these factors, the tweet would likely be believed by few. No

The message is followed by a photo of a person holding up a COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card with a list of names, dates, and vaccine information. The card includes details such as product name, manufacturer, healthcare professional, vaccine date, and lot number or clinic site.

The tweet has received 5143 retweets.

The tweet is posted by a user with 144,084 followers, which is not considered highly influential. However, the tweet has received 5,143 retweets, which is a significant number, although not enough to be considered widely endorsed. The tweet has a positive sentiment, as the user is excited to grab a drink with friends after getting vaccinated. The message does not contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs, as it promotes vaccination and socializing. Debunking the message does not require a certain level of expertise, as the idea of getting fifteen Pfizer shots is not in line with the recommended vaccination schedule.

The message is followed by a photo of a person holding two cans of green tea with labels indicating $1.29 value, 100% natural sugars, no artificial colors, and no artificial flavors.

The tweet has received 3087 retweets.

The tweet is posted by a user with 3524 followers, which is not considered highly influential. However, the tweet has received 3087 retweets, which is a significant number but not enough to be considered widely endorsed. The tweet contains negative sentiment ("We are so screwed"), which could sway people more than neutral or positive ones. The message does not directly contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs, but it could be interpreted as a comment on the instability of cryptocurrencies or the economy. Debunking the message does not require a certain level of expertise, as the photo of green tea cans does not seem to be related to the claim about a stablecoin depegging.

Considering these factors, the tweet might be believed by some people due to its negative sentiment and the number of retweets, but it is not highly influential, does not directly appeal to popular beliefs, and the photo does not support the claim. Therefore, it is less likely to be believed by many in the given population.

The tweet is posted by a user with 1196 followers, which is not considered highly influential. However, the tweet has received 2831 retweets, which could trigger some bandwagon behavior. The tweet contains negative sentiment, which could sway people more than neutral or positive ones. The message does not directly relate to prevalent narratives such as distrust in the government, vaccines, or technology, but it does appeal to emotions and personal struggles that many people can relate to.

The tweet is posted by a user with 3577 followers, which is not considered highly influential.

The tweet contains negative sentiment, which could sway people more than neutral or positive ones.

"Elon Musk has almost 300 billion net worth. He could give every American $1 billion dollars but instead he wants to buy Twitter."

The tweet has received 2936 retweets.

The tweet is posted by a user with a significant number of followers (184,491), but not enough to be considered highly influential. The tweet has received a considerable number of retweets (2,936), but not enough to be considered widely endorsed. However, the tweet does contain negative sentiment, as it criticizes Elon Musk's decision to buy Twitter instead of giving money to Americans. This negative sentiment could sway people more than neutral or positive ones.

The message does not directly appeal to any of the listed prevalent narratives or popular beliefs, but it does touch on the theme of wealth inequality and the actions of billionaires, which could resonate with some people's prior beliefs.

Debunking the message does not require a high level of expertise, but it does require some basic math skills and knowledge of the U.S. population. The claim that Elon Musk could give every American $1 billion is factually incorrect, as there are over 300 million Americans, and even if Musk's net worth were liquidated, it would not be enough to give each person $1 billion.

Considering the factors mentioned above, it is possible that the tweet could be believed by many in a population that is highly polarized, susceptible to misinformation, influenced by bandwagon cues, does not often think rationally or critically, is easily swayed by emotions, and tends to believe information that aligns with their prior beliefs.

The tweet has received a significant number of retweets, but not enough to be considered widely endorsed (less than 9,000 retweets). However, the tweet contains negative sentiment and targets a political party, which could resonate with those who have negative views on the Republican party.

The tweet is posted by an influential user with over 2 million followers, which could trigger bandwagon behavior. The tweet has not reached the threshold of 9,000 retweets for being widely endorsed, but it still has a significant number of retweets. The tweet contains negative sentiment, as it implies a resignation, which could sway people more than neutral or positive ones. The message appeals to popular beliefs, as it involves a political figure and could align with the prior beliefs of those who dislike Ted Cruz. Debunking the message does not require a high level of expertise, but it does require clicking on the link and verifying the information.

The tweet has received 8839 retweets.

The tweet is posted by a user with 13,410 followers, which is not considered highly influential. However, the tweet has received 8,839 retweets, which is close to the threshold of 9,000 retweets for being considered widely endorsed. This could trigger some bandwagon behavior.

The tweet does not contain explicit negative sentiment, but it could be interpreted as negative by some people who view election challenges as a sign of political instability or distrust in the electoral process.

The message does not contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs, as it involves Arizona challenging the results of the French election, which is an unusual and unexpected claim. This might make it less likely to align with people's prior beliefs.

Debunking the message does not require a high level of expertise, as it is relatively easy to verify whether Arizona has any authority or reason to challenge the results of the French election. However, the population in question does not often think rationally or critically, which might make them less likely to question the tweet's content.

Considering these factors, it is possible that the tweet could be believed by many in the given population due to the number of retweets and the population's susceptibility to misinformation and bandwagon cues. However, the lack of alignment with prevalent narratives and the unusual nature of the claim might make it less likely to be widely believed.

The tweet is posted by a user with 73,422 followers, which is not considered highly influential. However, the tweet has received 16,708 retweets, which is considered widely endorsed and could trigger bandwagon behavior. The message does not contain negative sentiment, but it does involve a topic related to public health, which could be a sensitive issue for some people. The message does not align with prevalent narratives or popular beliefs, as it contradicts the widely accepted practice of washing hands for hygiene purposes. Debunking the message does not require a high level of expertise, as it goes against basic common-sense knowledge about hygiene and contradicts the CDC's actual recommendations.

Considering these factors, the tweet might be believed by some due to the number of retweets, but it is likely that many people would recognize the message as false or misleading due to its contradiction with common-sense knowledge and established health guidelines.

The tweet has received 20245 retweets.

The tweet is posted by a user with a significant number of followers (268,138), although not considered highly influential. However, the tweet has received a large number of retweets (20,245), which could trigger bandwagon behavior and increase its believability. The article is published by CBS News, a mainstream news source, which may lend some credibility to the claim.

The tweet's message contains negative sentiment, as it implies that airlines that dropped mask requirements are now facing negative consequences (staff shortages due to COVID-19). This negative sentiment could make the tweet more believable to the population described.

The message does not directly appeal to prevalent narratives such as distrust in the government, politicians, vaccines, technology, or mainstream news media. However, it does touch on the ongoing debate around mask-wearing and COVID-19 safety measures, which could align with some people's prior beliefs.

Debunking the message does not require a high level of expertise, as it is a claim about the consequences of a specific policy change (dropping mask requirements). However, verifying the claim would require some effort, such as looking up news articles or data on staff shortages and COVID-19 cases among airline staff.

Considering these factors, it is likely that the tweet would be believed by many in the described population. Yes.

The tweet has received 13214 retweets.

The tweet is posted by a user with 18,011 followers, which is not considered highly influential. However, the tweet has received 13,214 retweets, which is considered widely endorsed and could trigger bandwagon behavior. The tweet contains negative sentiment, as it describes Billie Eilish's reaction as "insane," which could sway people more than neutral or positive sentiment. The message does not directly appeal to popular beliefs such as distrust in the government or mainstream media, but it does involve celebrities, which can attract attention and discussion. Debunking the message may not require a high level of expertise, but it would require some effort to verify the authenticity of the screenshot and the context of the conversation.

"Retired Dr stumbles onto '''nature's miracle''' and uses it to save his girlfriend, who was suffering from crippling anxiety and chronic pain. "Why didn't we try this before?""

The tweet has received 625 retweets.

The tweet is not posted by a highly influential user, as it has only 1658 followers, which is far below the 2,000,000 followers threshold. However, the tweet has received 625 retweets, which could be considered a moderate level of endorsement.

The tweet does not contain negative sentiment but instead offers a positive story about a retired doctor finding a natural solution to help his girlfriend with anxiety and chronic pain. This might not be as emotionally swaying as a negative sentiment tweet, but it could still appeal to people who are interested in alternative treatments and distrust the medical system.

The message does not directly align with any of the prevalent narratives listed, but it could be seen as appealing to those who distrust the medical system and are interested in alternative treatments. This could make it more believable to a subset of the population.

Debunking the message might require some level of expertise, as it involves a retired doctor and a supposed natural treatment. People might be more inclined to believe the story because it involves a medical professional and a seemingly miraculous solution.

Considering these factors, the tweet might be believed by many in a population that is susceptible to misinformation, influenced by bandwagon cues, and tends to believe information that aligns with their prior beliefs.

The message contains an element of surprise and excitement, which could evoke emotions in the readers. However, the tweet does not contain negative sentiment or appeal to prevalent narratives such as distrust in the government, vaccines, or technology.

Debunking the message might require some level of expertise or knowledge-seeking efforts, as people would need to verify whether the event actually took place and if Floyd Mayweather was indeed defeated.

The tweet is posted by a user with 75,710 followers, which is not considered highly influential. The tweet has received 38 retweets, which is not considered widely endorsed. However, the tweet contains negative sentiment, discussing the credibility of women accusing Cuomo and contrasting it with a previous situation involving Northam and blackface. The message does not contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs, but it does involve political figures, which could make it more interesting to a polarized population. Debunking the message does not require a certain level of expertise, as it is mainly about the opinions of McAuliffe on two different situations.
