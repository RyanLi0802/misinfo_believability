 - is influenced by bandwagon cues,
 - does not often think rationally or critically,
 - is easily swayed by emotions, especially negative ones, and

would its message be believed by many or by few?

When evaluating the tweet's believability, reason about the following factors:
1. Is the tweet posted by an influential user? And does the tweet get many endorsements?
Users with more than 2,000,000 followers are considered highly influential, and tweets with more than 9,000 retweets are considered widely endorsed. User popularity and tweet endorsements could trigger bandwagon behavior and are positively correlated with believability.

2. Does the tweet contain negative sentiment?
Negative sentiment and negative emotions such as hate, anger, and fear could sway people more than positive ones. Therefore, tweets with negative sentiment are generally more likely to be believed by many than tweets with positive sentiment.

3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?
People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,

When evaluating the tweet's believability, reason about the following factors:
1. Is the tweet posted by an influential user? And does the tweet get many endorsements?
Users with more than 2,000,000 followers are considered highly influential, and tweets with more than 9,000 retweets are considered widely endorsed. User popularity and tweet endorsements could trigger bandwagon behavior and are positively correlated with believability.

2. Does the tweet contain negative sentiment?
Negative sentiment and negative emotions such as hate, anger, and fear could sway people more than positive ones. Therefore, tweets with negative sentiment are generally more likely to be believed by many than tweets with positive sentiment.

3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?
People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,
- distrust in mainstream news media.

The author of the tweet has 122603 followers, and the tweet itself has 57197 retweets. The author is moderately influential, and the tweet has received a significant number of endorsements, which might trigger bandwagon behavior. However, the tweet is written in a light-hearted and positive sentiment, which is less likely to sway people than negative emotions. Furthermore, the tweet doesn't contain any prevalent narratives or appeal to popular beliefs, as it is focused on a cute and entertaining video of a piglet.

Therefore, the tweet is likely going to be believed by few.

The tweet has received 2832 retweets.

If this tweet were spread to a population that 
 - is highly polarized,
 - is susceptible to misinformation,
 - is influenced by bandwagon cues,
 - does not often think rationally or critically,
 - is easily swayed by emotions, especially negative ones, and
 - tends to believe information that aligns with their prior beliefs,
would its message be believed by many or by few?

When evaluating the tweet's believability, reason about the following factors:
1. Is the tweet posted by an influential user? And does the tweet get many endorsements?
Users with more than 2,000,000 followers are considered highly influential, and tweets with more than 9,000 retweets are considered widely endorsed. User popularity and tweet endorsements could trigger bandwagon behavior and are positively correlated with believability.

2. Does the tweet contain negative sentiment?
Negative sentiment and negative emotions such as hate, anger, and fear could sway people more than positive ones. Therefore, tweets with negative sentiment are generally more likely to be believed by many than tweets with positive sentiment.

3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?
People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,
- distrust in mainstream news media.

After you are done with your reasoning, please provide a single token yes/no answer.

The author of the tweet has 521489 followers, and the tweet itself has 534 retweets. The author is somewhat influential, but the tweet only received a moderate number of endorsements, which might not be enough to trigger strong bandwagon behaviors. The tweet contains negative sentiment by accusing another account of being racist and homophobic, and negative emotions sway people more than neutral or positive ones. The message also appeals to the popular belief of standing against hate and discrimination, which might resonate with many people.

However, the tweet's moderate endorsements and the fact that it is not directly related to any of the most prevalent narratives (such as distrust in the government or politicians) might limit its impact.
