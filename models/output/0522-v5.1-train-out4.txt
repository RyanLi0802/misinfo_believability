The tweet has received 176 retweets.

This tweet is posted by an influential user with over 1.9 million followers. However, it has received relatively few retweets (176).

The tweet has received 7,361 retweets, which is a significant number and indicates some level of endorsement. The message does not contain strong negative sentiment, but it does involve a topic that might be of interest to many people: the wealth of popular streamers.

However, the tweet includes an unlikely claim, such as "Obama" being one of the richest streamers, which might be seen as a joke or satire. This could make the tweet less believable to some people. Debunking the message might not require a high level of expertise, as the information about the wealth of streamers could be easily researched and verified.

Considering these factors, the tweet's message might be believed by few in the given population due to the satirical nature of the claim and the easiness to debunk. However, the message might still appeal to some people due to the author's high influence and the number of endorsements.

The tweet has received 2936 retweets.

The user who posted this tweet has a moderate following of 184,491 followers, which is not considered highly influential. The tweet has received 2,936 retweets, which is not enough to indicate widespread endorsement or trigger bandwagon behavior. The message contains negative sentiment, criticizing Elon Musk's wealth and suggesting that he could use it to benefit every American instead of buying Twitter. This aligns with prevalent narratives of distrust in wealthy individuals and large tech companies.

However, debunking the message does not require a high level of expertise. A simple calculation would reveal that Elon Musk's net worth, even if it were $300 billion, would not be enough to give every American $1 billion. There are over 300 million Americans, and dividing $300 billion among them would result in much less than $1 billion per person.
