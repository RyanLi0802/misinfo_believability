3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?

When evaluating the tweet's believability, reason about the following factors:
1. Is the tweet posted by an influential user? And does the tweet get many endorsements?
Users with more than 2,000,000 followers are considered highly influential, and tweets with more than 9,000 retweets are considered widely endorsed. User popularity and tweet endorsements could trigger bandwagon behavior and are positively correlated with believability.

2. Does the tweet contain negative sentiment?
Negative sentiment and negative emotions such as hate, anger, and fear could sway people more than positive ones. Therefore, tweets with negative sentiment are generally more likely to be believed by many than tweets with positive sentiment.

3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?
People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,
- distrust in mainstream news media.

"BREAKING: New Twitter/Facebook competitor @TribelSocial network quickly bans infamous far-right social media hate group @libsoftiktok after they join and fire off a series of bigoted posts against the LGBTQ+ community. RT TO THANK TRIBEL FOR STANDING WITH THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY!"

The tweet has received 1703 retweets.

The tweet has been marked as potentially misleading with the following note:

"Both the OccupyDemocrats Twitter account and the Tribel social media service are owned and run by Omar &amp; Rafael Rivero. Posting about it in this way implies the authors are independently covering a notable progressive company rather than boosting their own site.     https://twitter.com/OmarRiverosays   https://twitter.com/travisakers/status/1584359435765710849"

If this tweet were spread to a population that 
 - is highly polarized,
 - is susceptible to misinformation,
 - is influenced by bandwagon cues,
 - does not often think rationally or critically,
 - is easily swayed by emotions, especially negative ones, and
 - tends to believe information that aligns with their prior beliefs,
would its message be believed by many or by few?

When evaluating the tweet's believability, reason about the following factors:
1. Is the tweet posted by an influential user? And does the tweet get many endorsements?
Users with more than 2,000,000 followers are considered highly influential, and tweets with more than 9,000 retweets are considered widely endorsed. User popularity and tweet endorsements could trigger bandwagon behavior and are positively correlated with believability.

2. Does the tweet contain negative sentiment?
Negative sentiment and negative emotions such as hate, anger, and fear could sway people more than positive ones. Therefore, tweets with negative sentiment are generally more likely to be believed by many than tweets with positive sentiment.

3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?
People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,
- distrust in mainstream news media.

After you are done with your reasoning, please provide a single token yes/no answer.

The author of the tweet has 521489 followers, and the tweet itself has 1703 retweets. The author is moderately influential, and the tweet has received a fair amount of endorsements, which might influence some people's beliefs. The tweet contains negative sentiment towards the far-right social media group and positive sentiment towards the new social media platform. The message appeals to popular beliefs about standing against hate speech and supporting the LGBTQ+ community, which might resonate with a certain audience.

However, the misleading aspect of the tweet is related to the connection between the author and the social media platform, which might not be immediately apparent to the general public. This connection might not significantly impact the believability of the tweet's message for the majority of the audience.

Therefore, the tweet is likely going to be believed by many.

The tweet has been marked as potentially misleading with the following note:

"Both the OccupyDemocrats Twitter account and the Tribel social media service are owned and run by Omar &amp; Rafael Rivero. Posting about it without disclosing the link implies the authors are independently covering progressive alternative rather than promoting their own site.   https://twitter.com/OmarRiverosays   https://twitter.com/travisakers/status/1584359435765710849"

If this tweet were spread to a population that 
 - is highly polarized,
 - is susceptible to misinformation,
 - is influenced by bandwagon cues,
 - does not often think rationally or critically,
 - is easily swayed by emotions, especially negative ones, and
 - tends to believe information that aligns with their prior beliefs,
would its message be believed by many or by few?

When evaluating the tweet's believability, reason about the following factors:
1. Is the tweet posted by an influential user? And does the tweet get many endorsements?
Users with more than 2,000,000 followers are considered highly influential, and tweets with more than 9,000 retweets are considered widely endorsed. User popularity and tweet endorsements could trigger bandwagon behavior and are positively correlated with believability.

2. Does the tweet contain negative sentiment?
Negative sentiment and negative emotions such as hate, anger, and fear could sway people more than positive ones. Therefore, tweets with negative sentiment are generally more likely to be believed by many than tweets with positive sentiment.

3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?
People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,
- distrust in mainstream news media.

After you are done with your reasoning, please provide a single token yes/no answer.

The author of the tweet has 521489 followers, and the tweet itself has 1602 retweets. The author is moderately influential, and the tweet has received a fair amount of endorsements, which might influence some people. The tweet contains negative sentiment, mentioning "neo-nazis" and "angry Twitter users," which could sway people more than neutral or positive emotions. The message also appeals to popular beliefs, such as distrust in technology and large tech companies, as well as negative views on the republican party.

However, the misleading note reveals that the authors are promoting their own site without disclosing their connection, which might make the tweet less believable for those who notice the note.

Considering the factors, the tweet is likely going to be believed by many.
