The author is not very influential, and the tweet received few endorsements, which might negatively influence the tweet's believability. The tweet contains negative sentiment, as it warns people about a potential danger. However, the message conflicts with common-sense knowledge, as it is highly unlikely for a shark to be swimming on a highway, even during a hurricane. This makes the tweet less believable to the general public.

Therefore, the tweet is likely going to be believed by few.

A user with 781 followers has tweeted the following potentially misleading message:

"SMH, it's real... https://t.co/CIoTN2kVEy"

The message is followed by a screenshot at a certain time of a post by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, "People are rushing out to fill up their cars for this hurricane at the gas station. This wouldn't be an issue if they had electric cars. If the power is out for a week, how are they going to get gas? We need to start planning ahead and moving forward." The post was posted on Twitter at 09:05 AM, 30/08/2019.

The tweet has received 4851 retweets.

The author of the tweet has only 781 followers, and the tweet itself has 4851 retweets. The author is not very influential, but the tweet received a significant number of endorsements, which might influence its believability. The tweet does not contain explicit negative sentiment, but it implies criticism of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's statement. The message addresses a well-known political figure, AOC, and criticizes her views on electric cars and disaster preparedness. This might appeal to people who have negative views on the democratic party or distrust politicians in general.

However, the tweet's message does not contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs that are strongly polarizing, and it does not conflict with common-sense knowledge. Given the low influence of the author and the limited scope of the tweet's content, it is less likely to be believed by many.
