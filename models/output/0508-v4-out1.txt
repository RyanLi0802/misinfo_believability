"kids born in 2010 are turning 22 this year let that sink in"

The tweet has received 10278 retweets.

If this tweet were spread to a population that 
 - is highly polarized,
 - is susceptible to misinformation,
 - is influenced by bandwagon cues,
 - does not often think rationally or critically,
 - is easily swayed by emotions, especially negative ones, and
 - tends to believe information that aligns with their prior beliefs,
would its message be believed by many or by few?

When evaluating the tweet's believability, reason about the following factors:
1. Is the tweet posted by an influential user? And does the tweet get many endorsements?
Users with more than 2,000,000 followers are considered highly influential, and tweets with more than 9,000 retweets are considered widely endorsed. User popularity and tweet endorsements could trigger bandwagon behavior and are positively correlated with believability.

2. Does the tweet contain negative sentiment?
Negative sentiment and negative emotions such as hate, anger, and fear could sway people more than positive ones. Therefore, tweets with negative sentiment are generally more likely to be believed by many than tweets with positive sentiment.

3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?
People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,
- distrust in mainstream news media.

After you are done with your reasoning, please provide a single token yes/no answer.

The author of the tweet has 294541 followers, and the tweet itself has 10278 retweets. The author is moderately influential, and the tweet has received many endorsements, which might trigger bandwagon behavior. However, the tweet does not contain negative sentiment, and it does not address any prevalent narratives or popular beliefs. Moreover, the tweet's content is factually incorrect, as kids born in 2010 would be turning 12, not 22, in 2022.

Therefore, the tweet is likely going to be believed by few.

would its message be believed by many or by few?

When evaluating the tweet's believability, reason about the following factors:
1. Is the tweet posted by an influential user? And does the tweet get many endorsements?
Users with more than 2,000,000 followers are considered highly influential, and tweets with more than 9,000 retweets are considered widely endorsed. User popularity and tweet endorsements could trigger bandwagon behavior and are positively correlated with believability.

2. Does the tweet contain negative sentiment?
Negative sentiment and negative emotions such as hate, anger, and fear could sway people more than positive ones. Therefore, tweets with negative sentiment are generally more likely to be believed by many than tweets with positive sentiment.

3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?
People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,
- distrust in mainstream news media.

The author of the tweet has 147972 followers, and the tweet itself has 2659 retweets. The author is moderately influential, and the tweet has received a substantial number of endorsements, which might influence some people's beliefs. The tweet contains negative sentiment, as it portrays Rishi Sunak in a negative light, and negative emotions sway people more than neutral or positive ones. The message targets a political figure and implies discriminatory behavior, which might appeal to people who distrust politicians or have negative views on certain political parties.

However, the tweet's claim is based on a single photo without any context or additional information, which might make it less convincing for some people. Additionally, the tweet does not directly address any of the most prevalent narratives or beliefs.

Therefore, the tweet is likely going to be believed by many, but not as many as if it were addressing a more prevalent narrative.

The author of the tweet has 2119098 followers, which makes them highly influential. However, the tweet itself only has 220 retweets, which is not a significant number of endorsements. The tweet contains negative sentiment, and negative emotions sway people more than neutral or positive ones. The message accuses President Biden of pardoning thousands of violent felons, which might appeal to people who distrust the government and politicians, and those who have negative views on the democratic party.

Considering the influential author and the negative sentiment, but also the low number of retweets, the tweet might be believed by some, but not by many.

A user with 181187 followers has tweeted the following potentially misleading message:

"Mitch McConnell said he would resign if he doesn’t become the Senate Majority Leader in November. I think Democrats should run this message in every state. Voters despise Moscow Mitch all across the country. If you want to end McConnell’s political career, vote for the Democrats!"

The tweet has received 17589 retweets.

If this tweet were spread to a population that 
 - is highly polarized,
 - is susceptible to misinformation,
 - is influenced by bandwagon cues,
 - does not often think rationally or critically,
 - is easily swayed by emotions, especially negative ones, and
 - tends to believe information that aligns with their prior beliefs,
would its message be believed by many or by few?

When evaluating the tweet's believability, reason about the following factors:
1. Is the tweet posted by an influential user? And does the tweet get many endorsements?
Users with more than 2,000,000 followers are considered highly influential, and tweets with more than 9,000 retweets are considered widely endorsed. User popularity and tweet endorsements could trigger bandwagon behavior and are positively correlated with believability.

2. Does the tweet contain negative sentiment?
Negative sentiment and negative emotions such as hate, anger, and fear could sway people more than positive ones. Therefore, tweets with negative sentiment are generally more likely to be believed by many than tweets with positive sentiment.

3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?
People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,
- distrust in mainstream news media.

The author of the tweet has 181187 followers, and the tweet itself has 17589 retweets. The author is moderately influential, and the tweet has received a significant number of endorsements, which might trigger bandwagon behavior. The tweet is written in negative sentiment, and negative emotions sway people more than neutral or positive ones.

Therefore, the tweet is likely going to be believed by many.
