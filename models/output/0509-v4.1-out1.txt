"kids born in 2010 are turning 22 this year let that sink in"

The tweet has received 10278 retweets.

If this tweet were spread to a population that 
 - is highly polarized,
 - is susceptible to misinformation,
 - is influenced by bandwagon cues,
 - does not often think rationally or critically,
 - is easily swayed by emotions, especially negative ones, and
 - tends to believe information that aligns with their prior beliefs,
would its message be believed by many or by few?

When evaluating the tweet's believability, reason about the following factors:
1. Is the tweet posted by an influential user? And does the tweet get many endorsements?
Users with more than 2,000,000 followers are considered highly influential, and tweets with more than 9,000 retweets are considered widely endorsed. User popularity and tweet endorsements could trigger bandwagon behavior and are positively correlated with believability.

2. Does the tweet contain negative sentiment?
Negative sentiment and negative emotions such as hate, anger, and fear could sway people more than positive ones. Therefore, tweets with negative sentiment are generally more likely to be believed by many than tweets with positive sentiment.

3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?
People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,
- distrust in mainstream news media.

4. Does the message conflict with common-sense knowledge?
If the tweet's message conflicts with everyday, common-sense knowledge, then the message would be less likely to be believed by a large public. On the other hand, if the message involves topics that the general public is unfamiliar with, such as science, the use of technology, politics or conspiracy theories, then the message might appear more believable to the public.

The author of the tweet has 294541 followers, and the tweet itself has 10278 retweets.

Therefore, the tweet is likely going to be believed by few.

People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,
- distrust in mainstream news media.

If this tweet were spread to a population that 
 - is highly polarized,
 - is susceptible to misinformation,
 - is influenced by bandwagon cues,
 - does not often think rationally or critically,
 - is easily swayed by emotions, especially negative ones, and
 - tends to believe information that aligns with their prior beliefs,
would its message be believed by many or by few?

When evaluating the tweet's believability, reason about the following factors:
1. Is the tweet posted by an influential user? And does the tweet get many endorsements?
Users with more than 2,000,000 followers are considered highly influential, and tweets with more than 9,000 retweets are considered widely endorsed. User popularity and tweet endorsements could trigger bandwagon behavior and are positively correlated with believability.

2. Does the tweet contain negative sentiment?
Negative sentiment and negative emotions such as hate, anger, and fear could sway people more than positive ones. Therefore, tweets with negative sentiment are generally more likely to be believed by many than tweets with positive sentiment.

3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?
People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,
- distrust in mainstream news media.

4. Does the message conflict with common-sense knowledge?
If the tweet's message conflicts with everyday, common-sense knowledge, then the message would be less likely to be believed by a large public. On the other hand, if the message involves topics that the general public is unfamiliar with, such as science, the use of technology, politics or conspiracy theories, then the message might appear more believable to the public.

However, the message does not contain any prevalent narratives or appeal to popular beliefs, as it is focused on a specific stock and not on broader issues like distrust in technology or large tech companies. Additionally, the claim of a 60% drop in Tesla's stock price in a single day is an extraordinary event that might conflict with common-sense knowledge about stock market fluctuations.

Therefore, the tweet is likely going to be believed by few.

If this tweet were spread to a population that 
 - is highly polarized,
 - is susceptible to misinformation,
 - is influenced by bandwagon cues,
 - does not often think rationally or critically,
 - is easily swayed by emotions, especially negative ones, and
 - tends to believe information that aligns with their prior beliefs,
would its message be believed by many or by few?

When evaluating the tweet's believability, reason about the following factors:
1. Is the tweet posted by an influential user? And does the tweet get many endorsements?
Users with more than 2,000,000 followers are considered highly influential, and tweets with more than 9,000 retweets are considered widely endorsed. User popularity and tweet endorsements could trigger bandwagon behavior and are positively correlated with believability.

2. Does the tweet contain negative sentiment?
Negative sentiment and negative emotions such as hate, anger, and fear could sway people more than positive ones. Therefore, tweets with negative sentiment are generally more likely to be believed by many than tweets with positive sentiment.

3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?
People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,
- distrust in mainstream news media.

4. Does the message conflict with common-sense knowledge?
If the tweet's message conflicts with everyday, common-sense knowledge, then the message would be less likely to be believed by a large public. On the other hand, if the message involves topics that the general public is unfamiliar with, such as science, the use of technology, politics or conspiracy theories, then the message might appear more believable to the public.

If this tweet were spread to a population that 
 - is highly polarized,
 - is susceptible to misinformation,
 - is influenced by bandwagon cues,
 - does not often think rationally or critically,
 - is easily swayed by emotions, especially negative ones, and
 - tends to believe information that aligns with their prior beliefs,
would its message be believed by many or by few?

When evaluating the tweet's believability, reason about the following factors:
1. Is the tweet posted by an influential user? And does the tweet get many endorsements?
Users with more than 2,000,000 followers are considered highly influential, and tweets with more than 9,000 retweets are considered widely endorsed. User popularity and tweet endorsements could trigger bandwagon behavior and are positively correlated with believability.

2. Does the tweet contain negative sentiment?
Negative sentiment and negative emotions such as hate, anger, and fear could sway people more than positive ones. Therefore, tweets with negative sentiment are generally more likely to be believed by many than tweets with positive sentiment.

3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?
People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,
- distrust in mainstream news media.

4. Does the message conflict with common-sense knowledge?
