The author is moderately influential, and the tweet has received a significant number of endorsements, which might influence the tweet's believability. The tweet is written in a sarcastic tone, which contains negative sentiment, and negative emotions sway people more than neutral or positive ones. The message in the photo seems to be related to a controversial topic about race and could appeal to people who distrust large corporations or have strong opinions on racial issues.

However, the message on the can conflicts with common-sense knowledge, as it is highly unlikely that a well-known company like Coca-Cola would print such a message on their product. This factor might make the tweet less believable to a large public.

Therefore, the tweet is likely going to be believed by few.

BREAKING: Biden Pardons THOUSANDS of Violent Felons in Time for the Midterms, by @AnnCoulter https://t.co/yvbdNUcMeZ"

The tweet has received 220 retweets.

The author of the tweet has 2119098 followers, which makes them highly influential. However, the tweet itself has only 220 retweets, which is not a significant number of endorsements. The tweet contains negative sentiment, and negative emotions sway people more than neutral or positive ones. The message accuses President Biden of pardoning thousands of violent felons, which might appeal to people who distrust the government and politicians, and those who have negative views on the democratic party.

However, the low number of retweets might not be enough to trigger bandwagon behavior, and the claim might be seen as too extreme for some people.

Therefore, the tweet is likely going to be believed by few.
