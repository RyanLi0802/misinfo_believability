 - is highly polarized,
 - is susceptible to misinformation,
 - is influenced by bandwagon cues,
 - does not often think rationally or critically,
 - is easily swayed by emotions, especially negative ones, and
 - tends to believe information that aligns with their prior beliefs,
would its message be believed by many or by few?

When evaluating the tweet's believability, reason about the following factors:
1. Is the tweet posted by an influential user? And does the tweet get many endorsements?
Users with more than 2,000,000 followers are considered highly influential, and tweets with more than 9,000 retweets are considered widely endorsed. User popularity and tweet endorsements could trigger bandwagon behavior and are positively correlated with believability.

2. Does the tweet contain negative sentiment?
Negative sentiment and negative emotions such as hate, anger, and fear could sway people more than positive ones. Therefore, tweets with negative sentiment are generally more likely to be believed by many than tweets with positive sentiment.

3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?
People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,
- distrust in mainstream news media.

"Virginia directed 60,000 voters in a Dem area to the WRONG polling place

 - is highly polarized,
 - is susceptible to misinformation,
 - is influenced by bandwagon cues,
 - does not often think rationally or critically,
 - is easily swayed by emotions, especially negative ones, and
 - tends to believe information that aligns with their prior beliefs,
would its message be believed by many or by few?

When evaluating the tweet's believability, reason about the following factors:
1. Is the tweet posted by an influential user? And does the tweet get many endorsements?
Users with more than 2,000,000 followers are considered highly influential, and tweets with more than 9,000 retweets are considered widely endorsed. User popularity and tweet endorsements could trigger bandwagon behavior and are positively correlated with believability.

2. Does the tweet contain negative sentiment?
Negative sentiment and negative emotions such as hate, anger, and fear could sway people more than positive ones. Therefore, tweets with negative sentiment are generally more likely to be believed by many than tweets with positive sentiment.

3. Does the message contain a prevalent narrative or appeal to popular beliefs?
People tend to believe in things that align with their prior beliefs. Thus, misinformation that contains prevalent narratives and beliefs is much more likely to sway a large population of people than misinformation that doesn't. These popular narratives and beliefs include:
- distrust in the government and politicians,
- negative views on the democratic or republican party,
- distrust in vaccines and the medical system,
- distrust in technology and large tech companies,
- distrust in mainstream news media.
